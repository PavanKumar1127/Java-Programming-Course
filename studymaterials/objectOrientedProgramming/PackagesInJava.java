/**
 * In Java, a package is a way to organize related classes and interfaces into a
 * single unit. It helps in avoiding naming conflicts, provides a level of
 * access protection, and enables better organization of code.

public class PackagesInJava {

	/**
	 * Organization:
	 * 
	 * Logical Grouping: Packages allow you to logically organize classes and
	 * interfaces. For example, classes related to database operations can be
	 * grouped in a package named database. Avoid Naming Conflicts: Packages help in
	 * avoiding naming conflicts. Classes with the same name can exist in different
	 * packages without any issue. 
	 * 
	 * Access Control:
	 * 
	 * Visibility Control: Classes in a package have package-private access by
	 * default. This means they are visible only to other classes within the same
	 * package. Access Modifiers: You can use access modifiers (public, private,
	 * protected, or default/package-private) to control the visibility of classes
	 * and members within the package. 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Encapsulation:
	 * 
	 * Encapsulation Support: Packages provide a way to encapsulate classes and
	 * interfaces. You can hide the implementation details of classes that are not
	 * meant to be accessed outside the package. 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Naming Conventions:
	 * 
	 * Hierarchical Naming: Packages use a hierarchical naming convention. For
	 * example, com.example.util represents a package named util within the example
	 * subpackage of the com package. Prevents Naming Conflicts: The hierarchical
	 * naming convention prevents naming conflicts between packages created by
	 * different organizations or developers. 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Accessing Classes in Other Packages:
	 * 
	 * Import Statements: To use a class from another package, you can use the
	 * import statement. It allows you to specify the fully qualified name of the
	 * class or use a wildcard (*) to import all classes from a package. Accessing
	 * Classes Without Import: You can use the fully qualified name of a class
	 * without importing it, but it makes the code less readable. 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Java API:
	 * 
	 * Standard Libraries: Java Standard Libraries are organized into packages. For
	 * example, classes related to I/O operations are in the java.io package, and
	 * classes related to collections are in the java.util package.
