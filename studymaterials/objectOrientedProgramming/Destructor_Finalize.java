 * 
 * The finalize() method in Java is used for garbage collection. It is part of
 * the Object class and gets called by the garbage collector before an object is
 * reclaimed by the memory management system. However, it's important to note
 * that the finalize() method is considered somewhat obsolete, and its use is
 * discouraged in modern Java programming.
